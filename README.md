# IGBC green credit-based search
---

## Instructions

- install `requirement.txt`
- To run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
- LLM is not connected to the current implementation, search results are only fetched from the vector database.
- name of the credit(e.g. -Water Efficiency) is attached to the metadata of the corresponding chunk.
- Running the app for the first time might take time since it is creating vector db from the PDF
